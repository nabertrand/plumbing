# Tim Meusel

Hi,

I would like to propose Tim Meusel as PMC member.

Tim is a PMC member since a long time. He is awesome in his job, every time helpful, 
looking for improvements and does phenomenal community work. 

Tim manages a lot of modules from Vox Pupuli and put a lot of effort every day to make puppet 
and Vox Pupuli better

He also talks about Vox Pupuli and puppet on conferences, recently on CfgMgmtCamp 2024
