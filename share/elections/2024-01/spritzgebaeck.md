## About me

Hi, my name is Sebastian Rakel, last year I was nominated by @bastelfreak and got voted as PMC Member.

This year I want to apply again as PMC Member.

I'm a cloud engineer/devops dude in a small german compnay and love to automate things. 
In my free time I'm chairman of a hackerspace (Forschung und Technik e.V.) and father of an awesome daughter.

## My life with puppet

Since 2016/2017 I'm using puppet, joined #voxpupuli in 2017.
My private setup and my company setup are built on puppet. I wrote some modules (mostly not open source) and reviewed a ton of PRs in Vox Pupuli repositories.

## My life with Vox Pupuli

In addition to reviewing PRs, I edited some images, updated our website to a newer bootstrap version and currently working on a new puppetboard.
