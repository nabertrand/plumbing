# Nick Bertrand

I've been working with open-source Puppet since 2014 and am passionate about automation. I currently utilize Puppet OSE to manage 1000 HPC and infrastructure systems. I'd like to join the PMC to help ensure open-source Puppet remains a first-class configuration management system and believe my experience as solely a non-enterprise user could bring an important vantage point.

Some notable Puppet work:

  - Winner of 2023 May the Source Be With You Puppet hackathon most-valuable-contribution: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-yumrepo_core/pull/47
  - Puppet module dependency tool (not quite suitable for public consumption but works well for our site!): https://github.com/umnmsi/puppet-deptool
  - PEARC 2019 paper on open-source Puppet: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3332186.3332240
  - rspec-puppet Hiera layer customization: https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet/pull/732
