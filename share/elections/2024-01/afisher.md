# Alex Fisher

I, [Tim Meusel](https://github.com/bastelfreak), nominate
[Alex Fisher](https://github.com/alexjfisher) as a PMC candidate.

Alex is awesome! That's it. That should be enough as an introduction.

Alex, or afisher, is around since a decade. He already served at the PMC and it
is always a pleasure to work with him. Not only does he have a huge amount of
knowledge about the puppet ecosystem and is well known. He also attends the Vox
Pupuli office hours on a regular basis. He always provides great feedback and
always tries to find solutions for complex problems. Some examples are:

* Renaming puppet-lint and rspec-puppet-facts
* Fixing `ensure_packages()` in puppetlabs/stdlib
* Namespacing and deprecating functions in puppetlabs/stdlib
* Testing legacy Facts for Puppet 7 -> Puppet 8 migration

I would be more than happy to see Alex in the Project Management Committee.
